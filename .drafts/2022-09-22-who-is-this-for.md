This "who" section is supposed to help you identify and investigate aspects of any future you might want to be and to be able to offer links to guidelines, checklist, manifestoes that may be relevant,

Using these sources will help you decide whether you wish to engage with a topic or move on to another topic

Deciding just who you are is tricky. There are many lenses ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_lens ~ you can use to help you with your investigation. One issue is that many are complicated and require much study in order to be proficient.

The topic of "who am I now" is very "meta".

How can we actually be helpful?

* We build and extend crowd-sourced efforts such as Wikipedia and Craigslist
* We draw upon emergin AI resources
* We enable lively Q&A via Discourse and Discord

What can we help you find? There are huge bodies of knowledge available. The issue is not coming up a with a new solution; the issue is helping you sort through all the available solutions to find the ones you can engage with.

When do we help?

Young or old, dead or alive, willing or unwilling, there are ways to help and things thay can be done. The lenses of past, present and future may help "see through a glass, darkly.

Where can we help?
There's an app for eveything. Why not one for your digital afterlifr. Available always and where with an app in your pocket.

Why do you want the help?

### What is this "we" thing

The "we" is not a billionaire
The "we" is not a fortune 500
The "we" is not a government department
The "we" is not a startup - at least in the most-used sense.

There are, however, many examples successful "we" groups. Groups that you may never have heard of including:

* https://w3.org/;
* https://python.org/
* https://kernel.org/
* https://apache.org

These are all organizaing with millions or even billions of end-users,
