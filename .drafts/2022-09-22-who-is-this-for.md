### Who am I and Who are you?

This post is about the people of EverEverLand. It ideates - https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ideate - on the topic of how they may be organized. Fingers crossed:

 the old terms - vendor & customer, practitioner & patient, consultant & client - may be improved upon. In an ideal world the roles of each of the pairs listed above might reverse from time to time.

Here is what we know

### There are many of you

Our mission statement simply says "individuals and families". This could mean "you", in any place, at any time, at any period in your live. In other world there are billions and billions of you.

Nonetheless:

* You are who you are ~ an absolutely unique collection of hopes and aspirations
* What you will hope for tomorrow may be different than today
* Your hope mey be real or unreal, conscious or unconscious, good or bad

This "Who am I and Who are you?" section is supposed to help you identify and investigate aspects of any future you might want to be and to be able to offer links to guidelines, checklist, manifestos that may be relevant.

### How can we actually be helpful?

Deciding just who you are is tricky. There are many lenses ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_lens ~ you can use to help you with your investigation. One issue is that many are complicated and require much study in order to be proficient.

The topic of "who am I now" is very "meta".

Given "your" countless scenarios, what is the likelihood that "we" can help "you"? What is the probability that the sources we identify will help you decide whether you wish to engage with a topic or move on to another topic?

There are huge bodies of knowledge available. The issue is not coming up a with a new solution; the issue is helping you sort through all the available solutions to find the ones you can engage with.

Given the huge amount of data, solutions, ideas and stuff out there, the chance of you finding what you want is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.


### What can we help you find?

Times are changing. We can find needles now. Not always. Not perfectly. But we are getting there.

* We build and extend crowd-sourced efforts such as Wikipedia and Craigslist
* We draw upon emerging AI resources
* We enable lively Q&A via Discourse and Discord

When do we help?

Young or old, dead or alive, willing or unwilling, there are ways to help and things that can be done. The lenses of past, present and future may help "see through a glass, darkly.


Where can we help?
There's an app for everything. Why not one for your digital afterlife. Available always and where with an app in your pocket.

Why do you want the help?

### What is this "we" thing

The "we" is not a billionaire
The "we" is not a fortune 500
The "we" is not a government department
The "we" is not a startup - at least in the most-used sense.

There are, however, many examples successful "we" groups. Groups that you may never have heard of including:

* https://w3.org/;
* https://python.org/
* https://kernel.org/
* https://apache.org
* https://mozilla.org

These are all organizing with millions or even billions of end-users, hundreds of thousands of workers and salaried employees and lots of money (but not billions) in the bank..

They tend to be quite non-hierarchical, highly-collaborative, personally-fulfilling places to work and friendly to end-users. They are successful, growing and yet nimble. And they support aspects of anarchy and internal struggles and support that changes things from within.

They are all public-benefit nonprofit corporations. They all design, build and maintain a variety of aspects related to programming computers.

It is my thesis that that they can provide the operation of these organizations may provide a model for the creation, development and management of non-computer-related organizations.
