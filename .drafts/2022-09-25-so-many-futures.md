# 2022-09-25 So Many Futures

So the Long Now project is beginning to feels like it near end of life. Apart from the the odd talk or article nothing much appears to be happening. Is there any action on the clock itself. Maybe we shall hear about this in a newsletter. Otherwise nothing.

Sad. I hope I can find more.

Wish: I find people to talk to...
