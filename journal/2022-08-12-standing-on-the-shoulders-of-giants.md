Here is one of my favorite metaphors as posed in its most famous form:

"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants

> It means "Using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress

* Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Display gratitude: Name sources
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research

The first thing to do is find the giants

* They may not be obvious
* Build a list of links

If you can't find the giants, then maybe you are looking in the wrong places.


## Variations on the theme

Another way of looking at this, might take on Picasso thought:

"Poor artists copy. Great artists steal."

* See https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/

The DJ is an example of a profession based on standing on shoulders. DJs remix the efforts of others.

If you are actually going to see further - discover something new - the the positions of the various giants become the launching point of your new perspective. The new idea that occurs in a vacuum is rare

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements already written.


More thoughts around this:

* Maintain a neutral point of view
* Link to free content
* Cite verifiable sources
* Be respectful
* Be experimental
