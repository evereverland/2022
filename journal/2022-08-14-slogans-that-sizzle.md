A slogan is a short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising. Slogans are a special kind of phrase or aphorism.

I like slogans and aphorisms. An aphorism is a pithy observation that contains a general truth, such as, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". An aphorisms is a short and simple way of expressing or referring to something longer or more complex.

For example, aphorisms are useful in naming, describing or representing "mental models" of great complexity.

> A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about their own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.

People have compiled lists of mental models. There the names of the mental models often sound like slogans. They are like verbal icons - the media is verbal or aural rather than visual.

At a simpler level, aphorisms may also become slogans - offering information to consumers in an appealing and creative ways.

Good slogans excite, remind and focus.
