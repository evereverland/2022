_2022-10-08 ~ first draft_

The EverEverLand project has a mission and vision, but as yet there is no map of how to get there. Given our circumstances, most likely we will let other people and organizations be prime movers. Our role will be to help, document and motivate their activities. So then, who do we want to help? Below is a commentary on an obvious candidate.

I met the founder of OriginStory a few days ago. The website is a work-in-progress, nonetheless I find the site attractive, clear and compelling. I have observed a number of characteristics that speak for themselves. Rather than describe them, I have copy-pasted text directly from the site. The quotations are their own evidence ofthe characteristic being described. Note the following conventions:

> Text with a gray background has been copy pasted from OriginStory website

* Simple text preceded by bullets is ours


## A Vision is Apparent

>* Our memories inspire the future
>* A loved one’s memoirs are the most important family heirloom
>* Their memories and experiences are our OriginStory—and those stories are the true treasure of our existence

_Who are we talking about? Who are the players involved?_

>* Access to your personal family historian
>* Paired with your family's personal biographer
>* They'll attentively guide your loved one through a series of individual interviews

A client (you), and elder and a service provider are all defined.

## The Methodology is Detailed

_How do we go about achieving the mission?_

>* Initial consultation
>* 10x one hour interviews

The methods for creating the deliverable are defined.

## How Can EverEverLand Help?

In my dream utopia, there are thousands of OriginStory websites. They all collaborate in creating, maintaining and extending universal digital legacies. They are able to collaborate or compete because they follow agreed standards and guidelines.

How can EverEverLand Help? Perhaps by assisting with some of these aspects:

* Provide deep philosophical underpinnings to the effort
  * The value of the effort in helping define the future
  * Linking similar to efforts such as:
    * https://longnow.org/
    * https://www.romankrznaric.com/good-ancestor
    * https://www.effectivealtruism.org/
* Liaise with others
  * https://digitallegacyassociation.org/
* Help with other aspects of the digital afterlife
  * Contact with genealogists
  * Contact with Metaverse consultants
  * Dealing with "online" legacies
  * Connecting with family members that share the same interests
* Provide technical support
  * Sound and video support
  * Suitable very long-term digital archives
  * Access to historians to help with building backstories
* Help find customers
  * Liaising with retirement communities
* Help with marketing
* Help create standards and branding
* Provide support, guidance and encouragement
