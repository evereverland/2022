EverEverLand has a mission, but as yet there is no map of how to get there. Given our circumstances, most likely we will let others be the prime contractors. So then who would we want to help? Here is a commentary on an obvious candidate

I met the founder of OriginStory a few days ago. The website is a work-in-progress, nonetheless I find the site attractive, clear and compelling. I have observed a number of characteristics that speak for themselves. Rather than describe them, I have copy-pasted text directly from the site. Note the following conventions:

> Text with gray background has been copy pasted from OriginStory website

* Simple text preceded by bullets is ours


## A Vision is Apparent

_A vision is a statement of a desireable future_

>* Our memories inspire the future
>* A loved one’s memoirs are the most important family heirloom
>* Their memories and experiences are our OriginStory—and those stories are the true treasure of our existence.
>* These priceless vessels preserve irreplaceable cultural knowledge and family history

## The Mission is Clear

_A mission describes what you want to do now_

>* Tell the story of a lifetime
>* Your family history—professionally preserved for generations

## The Players are Introduced

_Who are we talking about?_

>* Access to your personal family historian
>* Paired with your family's personal biographer
>* They'll attentively guide your loved one through a series of individual interviews


## The Methodology is Detailed

_How do we go about achieving the mission?_

>* Initial consultation
>* 10x one hour interviews

## The Deliverables are Defined

_What does the customer get?_

>* High-fidelity, professionally mastered recordings
>* Privately-published, downloadable audiobook, complete with clickable navigation and TOC
>* Memoirs delivered as a beautiful, timeless audio document
>* Clean Recordings, Edited & Chapterized
>* Indexed and cataloged to preserve their unique history and experiences
>* Unique OriginStory webpage (includes secure hosting)

## How Can EverEverLand Help?

In my dream utopia, there are thousands of OriginStory websites. They all collaborate in creating, maintaining and extending universal digital legacies. They are able to collaborate or compete because they follow agreed standards and guidelines.

How can EverEverLand Help? Perhaps by assisting with some of these aspects:

* Provide deep philosophical underpinnings to the effort
  * The value of the effort in helping define the future
  * Linking somehoe to efforts such as
    * https://longnow.org/
    * https://www.romankrznaric.com/good-ancestor
    * https://www.effectivealtruism.org/
* Liaise with others
  * https://digitallegacyassociation.org/
* Help with other aspects of the digital afterlife
  * Contact with genealogists
  * Contact with Metaverse consultants
  * Dealing with "online" legacies
  * Connecting with family members that share the same interests
* Provide technical support
  * Sound and video support
  * Suitable very long-term digital archives
  * Access to historians to help with building backstories
* Help find customers
  * Liaising with retirement communities
* Help with marketing
* Provide support, guidance and encouragement
