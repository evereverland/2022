A central premise of EverEverLand is that in some imaginary future there will be virtual worlds where you will interact with historical personages immersed in a 3D locale that closely simulates the time, place and mentality of the personage you are chatting with. For example, you might be talking to a young man in a metal shop in what is now Brazzaville, Congo in 20 BCE or to an elderly woman working on a coffin on Hainan Island in China in 1492. While chatting you might be hearing music or street sounds in the background, and noticing the food on the table or art on the walls. Leaving the premises, you are now in a Google Street View that allows you to go to any latitude or longitude. There's a dial that allows you to set the time frame.

In other words, you will be immersed in a representation of history that is credible, authoritative and reliable. In principle, you should be able to look at the interactions through the "lens" of an anthropologist or political scientist or psychologist and gain the same kind of insights that you do in your current day-to-day world.

When I talk about this premise with friends and colleagues, they nod sagely, and smile, and think fondly about those imaginary decades that will happen in those many years in the distant future.

There's only one teeny thing wrong with this premise. It's not about some era in the future. Actually, we are already there. The technology to create the interactions just described is already on the market and in operation.

Here are four websites that turn recorded text or voice into apps where talking images respond to your questions

* https://storyfile.com/ ~ No-code platform provides tools to collect video, create and train AI interactions, and publish anywhere on the web ~ Talk to William Shatner
* https://www.hereafter.ai/ ~ Interactive app that preserves memories about your life for your whole family to enjoyâ€”forever
* https://myyov.com/ ~ Uses AI and machine learning to map and recreate the relationship dynamics between you and your loved one through conversation
* https://hourone.ai/ ~ Turn text into video, featuring virtual presenters, automatically

The technology to recreate the geography in 3D is in essence the same technology used to create 3D games. Here is a web page that lists video games that only depict events that happened in the 19th century:

* https://www.giantbomb.com/the-19th-century/3015-8430/games/
* https://www.twitch.tv/ ~ watch live games with real-time near photo-realism of highly detailed scenes

What about content? When we interact with a person on screen, it's crucial to know something about the person we are talking to. We want to be able to ask things like: Who are your parents? Every day thousands of new records are being added to genealogical databases. Examples:

* FamilySearch.org: number of searchable online records: 4.85 billion
* Ancestry.com: about 20 billion records
* MyHeritage.com: as of the date of this post, 11,091,106 records
* Findmypast.com: over 2 billion records

The tech and the content are all in place - albeit at early stages of development. Sadly there is no Google/Meta/Apple app available today that you can go to and say "take me to Babylon in the time of Nebuchadnezzar"

Nonetheless, it would be at all surprising if - as this project continues its investigations - bits and pieces of historically accurate immersive 3D interactions are being created in all manner of places and ways. Because:

"As William Gibson says, the future is already here but it's lumpy. It's unevenly distributed. Some people are already living this, the ones on low-lying islands off the coast of India are being swept away, you know, it's already happening to some people. We happen to be very lucky so far." :- Margaret Atwood

The role of EverEverLand in all this will be to help bring all these activities into some kind of alignment:

* List, keep track and publicize these efforts as a freely available online resource
* Establish guidelines and standards for relevant ethics, formats and processes
* Maintain lists and directories of service providers including genealogists, archivists and software developers

And further efforts may include:

* Publishing articles on Medium or SubStack
* Maintaining an online forum
* Establishing an online community of advocates

And, of course, there has to be a bonus goal.

* You are able, if you so choose, to do all of the above in an online immersive 3D world!

Putting all these glorious immersive dreams aside for the moment, the near-term efforts of EverEverLand are more mundane but doable and more immediately helpful. The tasks include efforts such as getting boxes of correspondence archived and into a library, helping people digitize photo albums, turning a box of 3x5 cards with recipes into a cookbook, getting an art collection photographed and online and the like.

The tricky thing is to find ways to use smaller projects to reinforce bigger projects.

Got any ideas?
