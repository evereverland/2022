### [Digital Afterlife Explained: What It Means & What You Can Do About It]( https://www.joincake.com/blog/digital-afterlife/ )

>Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook have algorithmic systems for nearly all of our major life events.
>
>We get a notification when a friend’s birthday is coming up, prompting us to post a “happy birthday” message. Memories pop up on our home pages, showing us photos we took years ago. We can easily tag friends and family members in photos and posts we want to share and memorialize.
>
>But social media doesn’t account very well for the most universal life event of all: death.
>
>You might still get urged to post “happy birthday” on the Facebook page of a friend who passed away last year. You might tag a photo with that friend, prompting the social media site to post the photo on that friend’s timeline, as though they’re still active online.
>
>Slowly, companies like Facebook are developing new ways to address death. For example, you can now “memorialize” a Facebook page if you’re listed as a “legacy” contact. You can even host a virtual funeral or memorial service on a platform like GatheringUs. But the exact rules surrounding digital assets and the digital afterlife still aren’t clear.

### [Why You Should Believe in the Digital Afterlife]( https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/what-a-digital-afterlife-would-be-like/491105/ )

>Imagine scanning your Grandma’s brain in sufficient detail to build a mental duplicate. When she passes away, the duplicate is turned on and lives in a simulated video-game universe, a digital Elysium complete with bingo, TV soaps, and knitting needles to keep the simulacrum happy. You could talk to her by phone just like always. She could join Christmas dinner by Skype. E-Granny would think of herself as the same person that she always was, with the same memories and personality—the same consciousness—transferred to a well regulated nursing home and able to offer her wisdom to her offspring forever after.

> If a complete stranger were granted access to every scrap of recorded information about you that exists in the world, would they be able to stand up at your funeral and deliver a personal, moving eulogy that captured the essence of you? Thanks to the modern digital world, the likely answer is yes.
