<summary>2022-08-14 Slogans that Sizzle</summary>
A slogan is a short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising. Slogans are a special kind of phrase or aphorism.

I like slogans and aphorisms. An aphorism is a pithy observation that contains a general truth, such as, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". An aphorisms is a short and simple way of expressing or referring to something longer or more complex.

For example, aphorisms are useful in naming, describing or representing "mental models" of great complexity.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model

> A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about their own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.

People have compiled lists of mental models. There the names of the mental models often sound like slogans. They are like verbal icons - the media is verbal or aural rather than visual.

At a simpler level, aphorisms may also become slogans - offering information to consumers in an appealing and creative ways.

Good slogans excite, remind and focus.

Can you add a phrase that is memorable, very concise and appealing to our audience?

* What is remembered, lives
  * From the film [Nomadland]( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770150/characters/nm0000531 )
* You only live twice
* Live happily ever after
* The end is not the end
* Curate your legacy
* Be a good ancestor

* Design your digital afterlife
* Build your own Heaven
* Let your life live on after your death
* Create the history of the future
* New homes for old things
* What is the after-living version of yourself?
* Artistically, a [thanatological]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatology ) [intervention]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_intervention )
* Effective altruism forever
* The last thing is a dingbat (❧)
* Are we really there yet?
* Will there be a happy ending?

Not to forget

* _memento mori_
* The end is nigh...
* It's to die for!

<details open><summary> 2022-08-12 Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</summary>

Here is one of my favorite metaphors as posed in its most famous form:

"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants

> It means "Using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress

* Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Display gratitude: Name sources
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research

The first thing to do is find the giants

* They may not be obvious
* Build a list of links

If you can't find the giants, then maybe you are looking in the wrong places.


## Variations on the theme

Another way of looking at this, might take on Picasso thought:

"Poor artists copy. Great artists steal."

* See https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/

The DJ is an example of a profession based on standing on shoulders. DJs remix the efforts of others.

If you are actually going to see further - discover something new - the the positions of the various giants become the launching point of your new perspective. The new idea that occurs in a vacuum is rare

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements already written.


More thoughts around this:

* Maintain a neutral point of view
* Link to free content
* Cite verifiable sources
* Be respectful
* Be experimental
