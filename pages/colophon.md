_We include a colophon to help you know about what older forms are being remixed into new forms._


## What is a Colophon?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)

In publishing, a colophon is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication. A colophon may include the device of a printer or publisher. Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books, but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere.


## Typeface for Titles

The typeface for all the titles in this website is [Windsor]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_(typeface) ). [Windsor]( https://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/ ) is a serif typeface created by [Eleisha Pechey]( http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-24790.html ) (1831-1902). It is intended for use such as display and in headings rather than for body text.

 The Windsor typeface was used on all the covers of the [_Whole Earth Catalog_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog ), for the titles and credits for [_Annie Hall_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall ) and most Woody Allen movies and a number of TV shows such as [_The Price is Right_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right_(American_game_show) ) and [_All in the Family_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_the_Family ).

 Use of the Windsor font on this website is a "new homes for old things" or [eating your own dog food]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food ) gesture.


## Typeface for Body text

Verdana, just because it's a highly legible font. And, perhaps, because it may resemble the [Univers]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers ) typeface as used in the [_Whole Earth Catalog_]( https://fontsinuse.com/uses/1578/the-last-whole-earth-catalog ).


## Files Saved as Text files with Markdown Formatting

Files are text files in [Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ) format.

>Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and [Aaron Swartz]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz ) created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
