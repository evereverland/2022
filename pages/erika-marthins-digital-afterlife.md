Today, we leave behind more than our material things when we pass. We leave our **digital legacy**. What kind of information do we want to be remembered by after our death?

What if there is eternal life in virtual worlds? How do we prepare for that? The dream of immortality is nothing new. Humanity has always longed to overcome death. Will the internet be a new way for humans to live forever.

## Knowledge
Initially, our ancestors passed on their knowledge to the next generation through storytelling. Later on, people use pictures, letters and printing processes to assemble data in writings. In the 20th century, the internet changed how we use our memory and communicate information. We no longer need to transmit our knowledge through words or writing. Everything is constantly accessible via our computers, tablets and smartphones.

The computer has become our alternative memory. It can store memories that are **“real”** and **“exact”**. When we compare it to the human brain, it becomes obvious how poor our own memory is. On the other hand, we don't really need to worry about our memory anymore because we have access to all human knowledge ever created.

It has also become our personal assistant. It is where we save the details of a large part of our lives. It has become our **“best friend”**, and it knows us better than even our own family and friends. Perhaps it knows us even better than we know ourselves.

## Data Collection
The memories we share on social media do not belong to us; all the information continues to live its own life online. It becomes part of a huge amount of data that lives **“on the cloud”**, which is an unreal place for most of us. Together, the memories and knowledge of humanity on the internet, becomes a universal intelligence.

Analyzing this new intelligence could give us a greater understanding of our own selves. It may even answer some existential questions. Maybe gathering this data is the easiest way to understand who we really are? To really understand our own intelligence, the only way might be to create an artificial one. But if there actually was a new type of intelligence, would we be able to recognize it?


## Digital Legacy
If our computer knows us better than we know ourselves – what happens to all this data after our death? When someone passes away, a great deal of the information gets lost. Relatives can keep artifacts from that person's past life. But if they had lived much longer, this person would probably be very different from the person that we used to know.

When I visited an old relative in a retirement home, it was hardly the same person that I remembered from many years ago. So if someone were to create an **after-living** version of themselves, it probably would be a lot more like the person that we once knew.

## Communication After Death
The possibility to communicate with a deceased person has always been a great desire. Facebook's pages have for some people expanded the cemetery as a new place to share memories and mourn together. Some people even bury their loved ones with their mobile phone to make it possible to continue to communicate with them after their death. Today there are online services that offer to send messages to loved ones that are no longer alive.

Just as there is a funeral business that sells gravestones and coffins, there is a new market evolving: one that makes money on the **fantasy** of talking to the dead without actually providing that service.

## Digital Afterlife
Digital afterlife is a complex topic. It raises more questions than it gives answers: questions about ethics and values in society. We no longer choose what to save. We save everything for the simple reason that it's possible. The trace of what to leave behind becomes very important. In the same way that we previously carefully considered personal belongings, we must now ensure that our loved ones have the possibility to access our online accounts and hard drives.

But, there are obstacles to take into consideration, like legal matters and technical issues. You must anticipate how to make your memories available because without prevention your digital legacy could vanish.

Today, with digital memory, forgetting is almost impossible. Whether we like it or not, traces of the deceased will linger in the space known as "online”. Perhaps the only way to move forward may be if social media platforms die, and with them our memories. As of yet, there's no good solution to the problem of dead data, of **digital ghosts**. The only hope is that the internet's memory will at some point begin to fade.

When an extension of life becomes a natural part of life, how will these different realities intersect? What happens if reality itself becomes blurred? Do we want to have an internet full of ghosts? What if in a near future one does not know if one is chatting with a living person or a ghost? Maybe it's time to start asking ourselves where we want the technology to take us, and most importantly to take us into consideration who we are becoming as humans. Do you want to live in a digital eternity?
