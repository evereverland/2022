_2022-08-14 Progress at the EverEverLand website is being made. The current state almost feels ready to share with a selected few!_


## Mission

Enable individuals and families - using all manner of media including digital - to knit together the threads of their lives so as to preserve connections, memories and artifacts for posterity.

### More missions

_An edited versio:n_

Enabling you and your people, using digital and other media, to knit together the strands of your lives and so to preserve your connections, memories and artifacts for posterity.


## Vision

What is remembered, lives

### More visions

Where have you been? What did you do? Where are you going?

Help people to - as [Kurt Vonnegut]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut ) said:

_Notice when you are happy. Exclaim or murmur or think at some point: 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'_

## 2022-08-14 Not "what do we do?" but maybe "how do we do it?"

What EverEverland eventually does - specifically and in any detail - may largely be determined by "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" (See eponymous entry in [Journal]( https://evereverland.github.io/2022/home/2022-08-13/ghpages-cms.html#pages/journal.md ) ). We will undertakle a comprehensive review of literature, websites and organizations. We will also have a good look at the current directions and trends regarding after-life management in general. Further directions will be defined by "eating or own dog food" and "practicing what we preach" (and other slogans) by dealing with the after-life content where we have already have access.

This process of of deciding "what do we do?" may take weeks, maybe even months. On the other hand, deciding "How do we do it?" appears to me like "having your cake and eating it too". Maybe, of course.

As we are learning with social networks such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the technology of connecting billions of people is readily available, nonetheless dealing with the various unintended consequences can be tricky.

The following is a list of things to think about. First the bad news: It's technical, arcane and probably incomprehensible to many people. Now for the good news: All of the following techie bits go along well-traveled, reproducible paths that have little or no cost consequences.

If you are feeling itchy, just jump to the conclusion at the bottom. ;-)


### Comprehensive, Authoritative and Ethical

No matter what we do, we want EverEverland to be comprehensive, authoritative and ethical.

For this, we can stand on the shoulders of giants. For example, we may follow the published standards for genealogical research.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy#Standards_and_ethics

> Standards for genealogical research include:
>
> * Clearly document and organize findings.
> * Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.
> * Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.
> * Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.
> * Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.
> * Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.
> * Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only "possible" or "probable" rather than "proven".
> * Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.
>
> Ethical standards adopted by various genealogical organizations include
>
> * Respect copyright laws
> * Acknowledge where one consulted another's work and do not plagiarize the work of other researchers.
> * Treat original records with respect and avoid causing damage to them or removing them from repositories.
> * Treat archives and archive staff with respect.
> * Protect the privacy of living individuals by not publishing or otherwise disclosing information about them without their permission.
> * Disclose any conflicts of interest to clients.
> * When doing paid research, be clear with the client about scope of research and fees involved.
> * Do not fabricate information or publish false or unproven information as proven.
> * Be sensitive about information found through genealogical research that may make the client or family members uncomfortable.


## Durability

At the same time, we may in some instance want EverEverLand to consider ensuring that the data we gather will survive "forever". This may mean allowing the material to be copied, remixed, morphed and preserved in a variety of ways unknown to us today.

In doing so we can follow the guidelines of free and open-source software:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software


>### Four essential freedoms of Free Software
>
>* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
>* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
>* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
>* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## Version Control

We hope to get large numbers of loosely organized groups of  people to collaborate in creating new content. Merging documents from all over the world across multiple time zones require a version control system.

Version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.


## Repeatability and Reproducibility = Standards

Perhaps the most important thing we can do is to ensure that EverEverland efforts are repeatable and reproducible all over the world under all manner of conditions.

Repeatability and reproducibility

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility

The normal way of achieving reporoducibility is by establishing standards

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard

>A technical standard is an established norm or requirement for a repeatable technical task which is applied to a common and repeated use of rules, conditions, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, and related management systems practices. A technical standard includes definition of terms; classification of components; delineation of procedures; specification of dimensions, materials, performance, designs, or operations; measurement of quality and quantity in describing materials, processes, products, systems, services, or practices; test methods and sampling procedures; or descriptions of fit and measurements of size or strength

Or perhaps by defining patterns - As defined by Christopher Alexander _et al_

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language

> The book creates a new language, what the authors call a pattern language derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, "All 253 patterns together form a language." Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop, or public building such as a school.


## Conclusion

The way EverEverLand will be effective will be because we can:

* Create programs, lesson plans, curriculums
* Build software and hardware tools
* Develope technical standards

Um, this feels like the specification for any software startup.

True, it's just that we are hitting on a new industry that hasn't been born yet - even though it's about death.
