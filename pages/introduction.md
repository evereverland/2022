### more missions

Enabling you and your people, using digital and other media, to knit together the strands of your lives and so to preserve your memories and artifacts for posterity

## Vision

What is remembered, lives

### more visions

Where have you been? What did you do? Where are you going?

Help people to - as [Kurt Vonnegut]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut ) said - "notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'”


## Slogans that Sizzle

Good slogans excite, remind and focus.Can you add any?

* What is remembered, lives
* You only live twice
* Live happily ever after
* The end is not the end
* Curate your legacy
* Be a good ancestor
* Design your Digital Afterlife
* Build your own Heaven
* Let your life live on after your death
* Create the history of the future
* New homes for old things
* What is the after-living version of yourself?
* Artistically, a thanatological intervention
* Effective altruism forever
* The last thing is a dingbat
* Are we really there yet?
* Will there be a happy ending?

Not to forget

* _memento mori_
* The end is nigh
* It's to die for

## Colophon

### Titles Typeface

The typeface for all the titles in this website is [Windsor]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_(typeface) ).Windsor is a serif typeface created by Eleisha Pechey in 1905. It is intended for use such as display and in headings rather than for body text.

 The Windsor typeface was used on all the covers of the [_Whole Earth Catalog_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog ), for the titles and credits for [_Annie Hall_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall ) and most Woody Allen movies, and a number of TV shows such as [_The Price is Right_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right_(American_game_show) ) and [_All in the Family_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_the_Family ).

 Use of the Windsor font is a "new homes for old things" gesture.

### Body Typeface

Verdana, just because it's a highly legible font. And, perhaps, because it may resembelt the Univers typefaces used in the _Whole Earth Catalog_.

### File Format

Files are text files in Markdown format.
