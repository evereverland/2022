_2022-10-24 Progress at the EverEverLand website is being made - gently. The current state almost feels ready to share with a selected few!_


## Current Mission

Enable individuals and families - using all manner of media including digital - to knit together the threads of their lives so as to preserve connections, memories and artifacts for posterity.

### More missions

_An edited version of the current mission_

Enabling you and your people, using digital and other media, to knit together the strands of your lives and so to preserve your connections, memories and artifacts for posterity.


## Current Vision

What is remembered, lives

### More visions to think about

Where have you been? What did you do? Where are you going?

Help people to - as [Kurt Vonnegut]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut ) said:

>_Notice when you are happy. Exclaim or murmur or think at some point: 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'_

## 2022-10-24 ~ Theo: Next Steps

This web site is now kind of working. Fingers crossed.

Some of the pages have some ideas or links of interest.

I have started documenting here and there some of the ways _**how**_ we can do things by:

* Setting standards for others to hollow
* Following the trajectories of successful open source projects such as Linux, Node and Python
* Making the use of all the good knowledge available on the Internet

The matter at hand is to establish what we want to do and why. Needles to say this is tricky - especially if you are like me and what to do everything just because it's there. ;-)

So what are we meant to do next?

As the ["Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"]( #journal/2022-08-12-standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants.md ) post suggests, we need to identify the giants and select which of their shoulders we want to stand on.

Two good places to start reading:

[Digital Afterlife: Death Matters in a Digital Age]( https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Afterlife-Artificial-Intelligence-Robotics-ebook/dp/B07Z6PBZCL )

[What We Owe the Future]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Owe_the_Future )

I will be reporting back on both works - as well as adding to the "links of Interest" pages.

In the meantime, do let me know what you think might be useful topics to discuss!
