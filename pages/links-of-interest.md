### [Digital Afterlife Explained: What It Means & What You Can Do About It]( https://www.joincake.com/blog/digital-afterlife/ )

>Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook have algorithmic systems for nearly all of our major life events.
>
>We get a notification when a friend’s birthday is coming up, prompting us to post a “happy birthday” message. Memories pop up on our home pages, showing us photos we took years ago. We can easily tag friends and family members in photos and posts we want to share and memorialize.
>
>But social media doesn’t account very well for the most universal life event of all: death.
>
>You might still get urged to post “happy birthday” on the Facebook page of a friend who passed away last year. You might tag a photo with that friend, prompting the social media site to post the photo on that friend’s timeline, as though they’re still active online.
>
>Slowly, companies like Facebook are developing new ways to address death. For example, you can now “memorialize” a Facebook page if you’re listed as a “legacy” contact. You can even host a virtual funeral or memorial service on a platform like GatheringUs. But the exact rules surrounding digital assets and the digital afterlife still aren’t clear.


### [Why You Should Believe in the Digital Afterlife]( https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/what-a-digital-afterlife-would-be-like/491105/ )

>Imagine scanning your Grandma’s brain in sufficient detail to build a mental duplicate. When she passes away, the duplicate is turned on and lives in a simulated video-game universe, a digital Elysium complete with bingo, TV soaps, and knitting needles to keep the simulacrum happy. You could talk to her by phone just like always. She could join Christmas dinner by Skype. E-Granny would think of herself as the same person that she always was, with the same memories and personality—the same consciousness—transferred to a well regulated nursing home and able to offer her wisdom to her offspring forever after.

> If a complete stranger were granted access to every scrap of recorded information about you that exists in the world, would they be able to stand up at your funeral and deliver a personal, moving eulogy that captured the essence of you? Thanks to the modern digital world, the likely answer is yes.

There's a good number of available books, but, wow!, why such high prices

Kindle: $57 Hardback $125

>Despite the range of studies into grief and mourning in relation to the digital, research to date largely focuses on the cultural practices and meanings that are played out in and through digital environments. Digital Afterlife brings together experts from diverse fields who share an interest in Digital Afterlife and the wide-ranging issues that relate to this. The book covers a variety of matters that have been neglected in other research texts, for example:

### [Digital Afterlife and the Spiritual Realm]( https://www.amazon.com/Afterlife-Spiritual-Artificial-Intelligence-Robotics/dp/0367565382 )

Hardcover $150

>Few religious leaders have examined the potential for the positive impact of digital media and digital immortality creation in religious contexts. It is evident that there have been recent moves away from traditional funeral services focusing on the transition of the deceased into the future world beyond, towards a rise of memorial content within funerals and commemorative events. This has heralded shifts in afterlife beliefs by replacing them, to all intents and purposes, by attitudes to this life.
>
>Digital Afterlife and the Spiritual Realm explores the ways in which digital media and digital afterlife creation affects social and religious understandings of death and the afterlife.

### Stewart Brand reflects on a lifetime of staying "hungry and foolish"

* https://text.npr.org/1123860510

>ZOMORODI: So not to end on a morbid note, but you do think a lot about the future, Stewart. May I ask what you want to happen after your death? Do you want to be an AI version of yourself to - I don't know - live on in the metaverse? Or are you going to have your body cryogenically frozen so we can de-extinct you (laughter)?
>BRAND: And, you know, it gives them freedom. They can pick and choose whichever version of the character. They pick the setting they want.
>ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So, like, we could just hang out with 1966 Stewart.
>BRAND: Yeah, sure. Why not?

>still hungry, still foolish
