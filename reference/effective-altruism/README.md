## My thoughts

### 2022-09-26

Will takes a complex topic (life) and wants to boil it alk down to just a few topics such as amount of happiness or whether life is god or bad.

There's nothing wrong with this, but it misses important aspects of life

* 24 virtues
* Beauty
* Security

Therefore

* A certain amount of EA is required and necessary
* EA by itself is not sufficient to carry the day

Makes mole-hills out of mountains
* Takes big diverse topics and translates them into simplistic formulas
* Where is the beauty, security & joy we desire

Scott Alexander is the best
