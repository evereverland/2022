>This Mum and Dad live inside an app on my phone, as voice assistants constructed by the California-based company HereAfter AI and powered by more than four hours of conversations they each had with an interviewer about their lives and memories. (For the record, Mum isn’t that untidy.) The company’s goal is to let the living communicate with the dead. I wanted to test out what it might be like.

>Technology like this, which lets you “talk” to people who’ve died, has been a mainstay of science fiction for decades. It’s an idea that’s been peddled by charlatans and spiritualists for centuries. But now it’s becoming a reality—and an increasingly accessible one, thanks to advances in AI and voice technology.

>As mentioned before, one of the primary goals of the purchase of the DNA kits offered by 23andMe is the discovery of one’s ancestry. Therefore, once the genetic result of the customer is revealed, the customer will have the chance to subscribe to a VR program where they will have the opportunity to interact with their digital ancestor. VR companies such as Oculus will partner with 23andMe to create several scenarios from the customer’s ancestral list. For example, if one of the customer’s ancestors is an official in ancient China, the VR company will create a digital copy of the official and allow the user to be placed in a historical setting with said ancestor.
